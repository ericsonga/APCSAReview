Mixed Up Code Practice
------------------------------

Try to solve each of the following. Click the *Check Me* button to check each solution.  You will be told if your solution is too short, has a block in the wrong order, or you are using the wrong block.  Some of the problems may have an extra block that isn't needed in the correct solution.  Try to solve these on your phone or other mobile device!

           The following code should calculate the cost of a trip that is 300 miles if gas is $2.50 a gallon and your car gets 36 miles per gallon.  However, the code has syntax errors, like missing semicolons, wrong case on names, or unmatched ``"`` or ``(``.  Fix the code so that it compiles and runs correctly.

        .. tab:: Answer
        
           Line 5 is missing a semicolon.  Line 6 has ``Double`` instead of ``double``.  Remember that the primitive types all start with a lowercase letter.  Line 8 has ``tripmiles`` instead of ``tripMiles``.  Remember that you should uppercase the first letter of each new word to make the variable name easier to read (use camel case).

           Lines 6 and 7 are both missing a ``/``.  Line 8 is missing a ``(``.  Line 9 is missing a ``}`` to close the ``main`` method.

           First calculate the number of gallons you have left and then multiply that by the miles per gallon to get the number of miles you can still drive.

           First multiply the output from Math.random() times 100 and then cast it to an integer.  This will result in a random number from 0 to 99.  Add one to make it from 1 to 100.
