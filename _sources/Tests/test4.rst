       :answer_a: All three are valid
       :answer_b: II only
       :answer_c: III only
       :answer_d: II and III
       :answer_e: None are valid
       :correct: d
       :feedback_a:  If there is not a call to super as the first line in a child class constructor then super() is automatically added.  However, this will cause a problem if the parent class does not have a no argument constructor.
       :feedback_b:  While II is valid so is another choice.
       :feedback_c:  While III is valid so is another choice.
       :feedback_d:  Since C1 has constructors that take just an int and just a String both of these are valid.  
       :feedback_e:  C2 constructors can call C1 constructors using the super keyword.  In fact this call is automatically added to C2 constructors as the first line in any C2 constructor if it isn't there.  

       Consider the following partial class definitions.  Which of the constructors shown below (I, II, and III) are valid for C2?
       
       .. code-block:: java

         public class C1 {
            private int num;
            private String name;

            public C1(int theNum) {
               num = theNum;
            }
   
            public C1(String theName) {
               name = theName;
            }

         }

         public class C2 extends C1 {
         // methods not shown
         }

         Possible constructors
         I.   public C2 () { }
         II.  public C2 (int quan) {super (quan); }
         III. public C2 (String label) { super(label); }

       :answer_b: x == y
       :answer_c: true
       :answer_d: false
       :answer_e: x < y
       :correct: d
       :feedback_a: If we assume that x is not equal to y then the expression is (false && true) || (true && false) which is false.
       :feedback_b: If we assume that x == y is the same than using it in the full expression should return true.  But, if x is equal to y you would get (true && false) || (false && true) which is false.
       :feedback_c: How can this be true?  Remember that && requires both expressions to be true in order to return true.  You can think of (x==y && !(x==y)) as A && !A which is always false.   You can think of ( x!=y && !(x!=y) as B && !B which is always false. 
       :feedback_d: This can be simplified to (A && !A) || (B && !B) which is (false || false) which is false.  You can think of (x==y && !(x==y)) as A && !A which is always false.   You can think of ( x!=y && !(x!=y) as B && !B which is always false.   
       :feedback_e: Since this expression is only about equality how could this be true?

       The Boolean expression (x==y && !(x==y)) || ( x!=y && !(x!=y)) can be simplified to which of the following?

       :correct: b
       :feedback_a: Should j be set to the savedIndex?  
       :feedback_b: This is a selection sort that is starting at end of the array and finding the largest value in the rest of the array and swapping it with the current index.
       :feedback_c: This would be correct if this was starting at index 0 and finding the smallest item in the rest of the array, but this starts at the end of the array instead and finds the largest value in the rest of the array.
       :feedback_d: Should j be set to the savedIndex? 
       :feedback_e: Why would you want to change the savedIndex if the values are the same?

       Which of the following could be used to replace the missing code so that the method sort will sort the array a in ascending order?

       :feedback_b: Methods in an interface are public, but more of these choices are correct.
       :feedback_c: Can you declare private methods in an interface?
       :feedback_d: One interface can inherit from another and the methods in an interface are public and abstract. 
       :feedback_e: One interface can inherit from another, but more of these choices are correct.

       Which of the following statements about interfaces is (are) true?  
       
       .. code-block:: java
       
         I.  One interface can inherit from another  
         II.  All methods declared in an interface are abstract methods

       :feedback_b: How did the values in row1 change to those in row2 and vice versa?
       :feedback_c: This would be true if all the matrix values were changed to their absolute value.  But, this only happens when the row and column index are the same. 
       :feedback_d:  This would be true if none of the values in the matrix were changed.  But, this will change the value to the absolute value when the row and column index are the same. 
       :feedback_e: This only changes the value in the matrix if the row and column index are the same.  So this changes the values at (0,0) and (1,1).

       Consider the following declarations.  If matrix is initialized to be: {{-1, -2, 3},{4, -5, 6}}.  What will the values in matrix be after changeMatrix(matrix) is called?

       :feedback_c: Go back and check your values each time through the loop.
       :feedback_d: This would be true if the loop stopped when i was equal to 6, but it stops when i is equal to 5.  
       :feedback_e: Keep a table of the variables and their values each time through the loop.

       :feedback_a: This is almost right, but there should be 4 of these steps.  
       :feedback_b: This is selection sort, not insertion.   Selection will find the smallest and swap it with the first element in the array.
       :feedback_c: An insertion sort will skip the first position and then loop inserting the next item into the correct place in the sorted elements to the left of the current item. 
       :feedback_d: This is selection sort, not insertion and it is also an incorrect selection sort since it skips one step.
       :feedback_e: This doesn't match selection, insertion, or merge sort.

       :feedback_a: The general formula for the number times a loop executes is the last value - the first value  + 1.  The outer loop will execute 3 times (2-0+1) and the inner loop will execute 7 times (7-1+1) so the total is 3 * 7 = 21.
       :feedback_b: This would be true if the inner loop stopped when j equals 7.
       :feedback_c: This would be true if the outer loop executed 4 times and the inner loop 8, but is that right?
       :feedback_d: This would be true if the outer loop executed 4 times, but is that right?

       :feedback_a: This could take a long time, but there is an answer that takes longer.
       :feedback_b: This would be true if we were looking for the shortest execution of a binary search
       :feedback_c: This would be the second value checked if the value at the middle is greater than the desired value.  
       :feedback_d: This will always take the longest when you are doing binary search.  
       :feedback_e: This would be the second value checked if the value at the middle is less than the desired value.

       :feedback_a: This would be true if none of the children classes overrode the speak method, but many do.
       :feedback_b: It is always okay to substitute a child object for a parent object.  
       :feedback_c: This would be true if Pig had a speak method that returned "Oink" and Bird had a speak method that returned "Tweet", but they do not.  The inherited speak method will be called in Animal.  
       :feedback_d: This would be true if Pig had a speak method that returned "Oink", but it does not.  
       :feedback_e: Both Pig and Bird do not have a speak method so the one in Animal will be used.  
       
       Given the following array declaration and the fact that Animal is the parent class for Bird, Dog, Pig, Cat, and Cow, what is output from looping through this array of animals and asking each object to speak()? 
       
       .. code-block:: java

          Animal[] a = { new Cat(), new Cow(), new Dog(), new Pig(), new Bird() }
          
          Animal that has a method speak() which returns "Awk". 
          Bird doesn’t have a speak method 
          Dog has a speak method that returns “Woof”
          Pig doesn’t have a speak method
          Cow has a speak method that returns “Moo”
          Cat has a speak method that returns "Meow"

       :feedback_b: You can't just subtract the two numbers since they are in different bases.  Convert both to decimal first.
       :feedback_c: 17 in base 16 is 23 in base 10.  13 in base 8 is 11 in base 10.  The answer is 12 in base 10 which is 00001100 in base 2.

       :feedback_a: The value of a[1] will be doubled since passing a copy of the value of s is a copy of the reference to the array.  The value in b won't change since y will be set to a copy of b's value which is just a number.
       :feedback_b: What about a[1] = a[1] * 2?
       :feedback_c: Remember that the first index in an array is index 0.  This code will double the second value in the array (the one at index 1).
       :feedback_d: Java passes arguments by creating a copy of the current value so the value of b won't be affected by changes to y.
       :feedback_e: Java passes arguments by creating a copy of the current value so the value of b won't be affected by changes to y.

       :feedback_c: Selection sort always takes the same amount of time to execute.  
       :feedback_d: Mergesort does use recursion (has a method that calls itself).  Insertion sort does take longer to execute when the items to be sorted are in ascending order and you want them in descending order.
       :feedback_e: Selection sort always takes the same amount of time to execute.  
       
       Which of the following is (are) true?

         I.  Insertion sort takes longer when the array is sorted in ascending order and
             you want it sorted in descending order.  
         II.  Mergesort uses recursion.  
         III.  Selection sort takes less time to execute if the array is already sorted
               in the correct order.

       :answer_a: The method is recursive and the first call it will compare 3 to 5 and then do mystery(3,4,5).
       :answer_b: There are two calls: mystery(0, 4, 5) and mystery(3, 4, 5).
       :answer_c: This would be true if it was mystery(0, 4, 7);
       :answer_d: This would be true if we were looking for a number that isn't in the array.
