      :correct: a
      :feedback_a: This is a recursive method.  It will return 10 when a is equal to 1, otherwise it will do a recursive call.  Each call adds 10.   
      :feedback_b: This would be true if the call was m(2).
      :feedback_c: This would be true if the call was m(6).
      :feedback_d: This would be true if the call was m(1).
      :feedback_e: This would be true if the call was m(3).

      :feedback_a: This is the result of mystery(7) since this method is 2 to the nth power.  
      :feedback_b: This would be the result of mystery(8).
      :feedback_c: This would be the result of mystery(6).

      :answer_c: All will return true
      :answer_d: I, II, and III only
      :answer_e: III, IV, and V only
      :correct: b
      :feedback_a: How about III and V?  Since int3 was set to int2 they do refer to the same object.  
      :feedback_b: The variables int1 and int2 refer to two different objects (even though they have the same value) so IV will be false.  
      :feedback_c: Look at IV.  Are int1 and int2 referring to the same object?
      :feedback_d: V is also true.  
      :feedback_e: I and II are also true since they have the same value.  IV is not since they don't refere to the same object.  

      Given the following code.  Which of the following would return true?

      :answer_a: The search value is not in the array 
      :answer_b: The search value is the last element in the array  
      :answer_c: The value is in the middle of the array. 
      :answer_d: The search value is the first element in the array. 
      :answer_e: Sequential search can never be faster than binary search.
      :correct: d
      :feedback_a: If the search value is not in the array, a sequential search will have to check every item in the array before failing, a binary search will be faster. 
      :feedback_b: In this case a sequential search will have to check every element before finding the correct one, whereas a binary search will not. 
      :feedback_c: This would be true for a binary search, not for a sequential search.
      :feedback_d: Only when the search value is the first item in the array, and thus the first value encountered in sequential search, will sequential be faster than binary. 
      :feedback_e: When the search value is the first element, sequential will always be faster, as it will only need to check one element whereas a binary search would start in the middle of the array and have to keep looking.

      Under which of these conditions will a sequential search be faster than a binary search?
   
   .. mchoice:: pe1_6
      :answer_a: Data set 1 since it has more test cases.
      :answer_b: Data set 2 since it only contains strings with lower case characters.  
      :answer_c: There are no advantages.
      :answer_d: Data set 1 since it has test cases with both upper and lower case characters.
      :answer_e: Data set 2 since it contains strings which should return true and should return false. 
      :correct: e
      :feedback_a: More test cases isn't necessarily better.  The tests should test the range of possible outcomes.  
      :feedback_b: It is actually better to test with strings that contain both upper and lower case characters.
      :feedback_c: Data set 1 only contains cases that should return true.  How about checking cases that should return false?
      :feedback_d: There is a better answer.  While it is good to test with strings that contain both upper and lower case characters there is another reason why data set 2 is better.
      :feedback_e: You want to test all possible results and data set 1 only contains strings that should return true.  

      There is a method called ``checkString`` that determines whether a string is the same forwards and backwards. The following data sets can be used for testing the method.  Which is a best set of test cases?

      :feedback_a:  NamedPoint will inherit from Point all fields but the fields are private and they can not be directly accessed in NamedPoint.  You can use super as the first line in a constructor to initialize inherited fields.  You can also set your own fields in a constructor.  If you don't use super as the first line in a constructor one will be put there by the compiler that will call the parent's no argument constructor.
      :feedback_b: I is okay but III is also okay.
      :feedback_c: II is invalid.  Children inherit all of the fields from a parent but do not have direct access to private fields.  You can use super in a constructor to initialize inherited fields by calling the parent's constructor with the same parameter list.
      :feedback_d: I is also okay
      :feedback_e: I is okay but II is invalid.  Children inherit all of the fields from a parent but do not have direct access to private fields.  You can use super in a constructor to initialize inherited fields by calling the parent's constructor with the same parameter list.

      :feedback_a: This would be true for the shortest execution.  This would only take one execution of the loop. 
      :feedback_b: This would take 5 executions of the loop. 
      :feedback_c: This would take 3 executions of the loop.
      :feedback_d: A sequential search loops through the elements of an array starting with the first and ending with the last and returns from the loop as soon as it finds the passed value.  It has to check every value in the array when the value it is looking for is not in the array.  This would take 10 executions of the loop.        
      :feedback_e: This would take 6 executions of the loop.

      Which will cause the longest execution of a sequential search looking for a value in an array of 10 integers?

      :feedback_a: All of these are valid reasons to use an inheritance heirarchy. 
      :feedback_b: In fact, all of the reasons listed are valid. Subclasses can reuse methods written for superclasses without code replication, subclasses can be stored in the same array, and passed as arguments to methods meant for the superclass.   All of which make writing code more streamlined. 
      :feedback_c: III is also valid. In some cases you might want to store subclasses together in a single array, and inheritance allows for this. 
      :feedback_d: II is also valid. In some cases a single method is applicable for a number of subclasses, and inheritance allows you to pass objects of the subclasses to the same method instead of writing individual methods for each subclass. 
      :feedback_e: II and III are also valid, in some cases a single method is applicable for a number of subclasses, and inheritance allows you to pass all the subclasses to the same method instead of writing individual methods for each subclass and you might want to store subclasses together in a single array, and inheritance allows for this.       

      Which of the following reasons for using an inheritance hierarchy are valid?
   
      .. code-block:: java
   
         I.   Methods from a superclass can be used in a subclass without rewriting 
              or copying code.
         II.  Objects from subclasses can be passed as arguments to a method  designed
              for the superclass
         III. Objects from subclasses can be stored in the same array
         IV.  All of the above
         V.   None of the above

      :feedback_a: This would be true if it was <code>return(a[1]*= 2);</code>.
      :feedback_b: This would be true if the return statement was <code>return (a[0]*=2);</code>.
      :feedback_c: This would be true if it was <code>a[0]--;</code>  Or it would be true if array indicies started at 1, but they start with 0. 
      :feedback_d: The statement <code>a[1]--;</code> is the same as <code>a[1] = a[1] - 1;</code> so this will change the 3 to a 2.  The return <code>(a[1] * 2)</code> does not change the value at <code>a[1]</code>.
      :feedback_e: This can't be true because <code>a[1]--;</code> means the same as <code>a[1] = a[1] - 1;</code>  So the 3 will become a 2.  Parameters are all pass by value in Java which means that a copy of the value is passed to a method.  But, since an array is an object a copy of the value is a copy of the reference to the object.  So changes to objects in methods are permanent.  

      Consider the following method and if ``int[] a = {8, 3, 1}``, what is the value in ``a[1]`` after ``m1(a);`` is run?

      :feedback_c: Strings are immutable meaning that any changes to a string creates and returns a new string, so the string referred to by s1 does not change 
      :feedback_d: This would be true if we had s1 = s4; after s4 = null; was executed.  Strings are immutable and so any changes to a string returns a new string.

      :feedback_d: Values equal to temp will not cause an infinite loop.

      :feedback_c: The first test is false since num2 is less than 0 and for a complex conditional joined with And (&&) to be true both expressions must be true.  Next, <code>else if ((num2<0) || (num1<0))</code> is executed and this will be true since num2 is less than 0 and for a complex conditional joined with Or (||) only one of the expressions must be true for it to execute.
