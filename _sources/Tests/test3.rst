       :correct: c
       :feedback_a: This would be true if it was adding up all the values in the third column, the one at index 2.  
       :feedback_b: This would be true if it was adding up all the values in the first column, the one at index 0.
       :feedback_c: This code adds up all the values in the second column, the one at index 1 since column indicies start at 0.
       :feedback_d: This would be true if it was adding up all the values in the last column, the one at index 3.  
       :feedback_e: This would be true if it was adding up all the values in the first row, but the row changes each time through the for loop.

       What is the value of total after the following code executes?
       
       .. code-block:: java

           int[][] matrix = {{4, 5, 6, 7}, {0, 1, 2, 3}, {3, 2, 1, 0}, {8, 9, 1, 2}};

       :answer_a: There is no difference.  
       :answer_b: Abstract classes can have methods with bodies (code in them), but interfaces can not.
       :answer_c: Abstract classes can be instantiated, while interfaces can not.
       :answer_d: Abstract classes can be extended, but interfaces can not.
       :answer_e: Abstract classes can declare abstract methods, but interfaces can not.
       :correct: b
       :feedback_a: An interface is a special type of abstract class that only has public abstract methods.  
       :feedback_b: Abstract classes can have both abstract and non abstract methods, interfaces can only have abstract methods.
       :feedback_c: You can't create an object of an abstract class type or of an interface type.  You can declare an object to be of either an abstract class type or an interface type (like declaring an ArrayList object as a List).
       :feedback_d: Interfaces can be extended (one interface can inherit from another interface).
       :feedback_e: The only type of method that you can have in an interface is an abstract method.  

       What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?

       :correct: d
       :feedback_a: This would be true if it moved all of the values from the front to the back.  But does it?  
       :feedback_b: This would be true if the code reversed the list.  But does it?   Remember that remove(0) removes the first item in the list and returns it.  The add method adds the item to the end of the list.
       :feedback_c: This would be true if only the value 2 was moved to the end of the list.  Is that what this code does?
       :feedback_d: This code moves the first item to the end of the list 4 times.  So it moves the 9, 3, 17, and 2.  
       :feedback_e: This would be true if the call was mystery(3) instead of mystery(4).  Then it would move the first 3 values in the list to the end of the list.

       Assume that list has been initialized with the following Integer objects: [9, 3, 17, 2, 16, 4, 1].  Which of the following shows the values in list after a call of mystery(4)?

       :answer_c: Inheritance (is-a)
       :answer_d: Association (has-a)
       :answer_e: Overloading
       :correct: d
       :feedback_a: An interface is a special kind of abstract class. It isn't a type of relationship between classes.
       :feedback_b: Polymorphism is using the run-time type of the object to determine which method to run.  It isn't a type of relationship between classes.
       :feedback_c: Inheritance is when one class (the child class) extends the other (the parent class).  Do you see the keyword extends here? 
       :feedback_d: Association is when one class keeps track of one or more objects of the other class.  In this case a DogOwner object has an array of dog objects.  
       :feedback_e: Overloading is when a class has two methods with the same name but the parameter lists are different.  It is not a type of relationship between classes.

       Given the following two class declarations, what is the relationship between Dog and DogOwner?

       :correct: a
       :feedback_a: The first line is the same as 3y.  Then you have to substitute in the new value of y in the second line (2 * 3y + 3y) = 6y + 3y = 9y.
       :feedback_b: This would be true if the second line was just y = 2 * y.  Remember that the second line is using the value of y calculated in the first line.
       :feedback_c: This would be true if the body only had the last line in it.  What do the first 2 lines do?
       :feedback_d: This would be true if the it was missing the second line.  What does that line do?

       :answer_e: There is no way to call a method in a grandparent class from a grandchild class
       :correct: e
       :feedback_a: This would run the test method in class C since the object was created by the C class.  When a method is called the runtime system will start looking for the method in the class that created the object.
       :feedback_b: You can't use super.super.  This would cause a compile-time error. 
       :feedback_c: This would run the test method in class B since super is used to run a method in your parent class and B is the parent of C.  
       :feedback_d: This would run the test method in class C.
       :feedback_e: You can use super to force the runtime to run a method in a parent class, but there is no way to force a call to a method in a grandparent (parent of your parent) class.

       Class C extends class B, which extends class A. Also, all of the three classes implement a public method test(). How can a method in an object of class C invoke the test() method defined in class A (without creating a new instance of class A)?

       :feedback_b: This would be true if the test method took two Car objects or a Car and a Vehicle object. 
       :feedback_c: This would be true if the test method took a SportsCar object and a Car object.  
       :feedback_d: This would be true if the test method took a SportsCar object and a Vehicle object. 
       :feedback_e: The test method takes a Car object and a SportsCar object.  Only this answer correctly passes a SportsCar object as the second parameter.  You can use a SportsCar object as a Car object since it is a subclass of Car.  The test method can be called on any child of Vehicle.

       :answer_e: 3
       :correct: a
       :feedback_a: The call recur(5) will return recur(4) + recur(3).  The call recur(4) returns 5.  The call recur(3) returns 3.  So recur(5) returns 5 + 3 = 8.
       :feedback_b: This method will only return 1 when n is less than or equal to 1.  In this case n is 5.  
       :feedback_c: This would be true if the call was recur(2).  This would return recur(1) + recur(0).  Both recur(1) and recur(0) would return 1 so recur(2) would return 1 + 1 = 2. 
       :feedback_d: This would be true if the call was recur(4). This would return recur(3) + recur(2).  The call recur(3) returns 3.  The call recur(2) returns 2.  So recur(4) returns 3 + 2 = 5. 
       :feedback_e: This would be true if the call was recur(3).  This would return recur(2) + recur(1).  The call to recur(1) would return 1.  The call to recur(2) would return recur(1) + recur(0).  Both recur(1) and recur(0) would return 1 so recur(2) would return 1 + 1 = 2. Thus recur(3) would return 2 + 1 = 3.

       :feedback_a: This would be true if k was printed when the reminder was equal to 1 (when the value was odd).  
       :feedback_b: This code will loop through all the values from 0 to 19, but only print the ones that are even (dividing by 2 has a remainder of 0).  
       :feedback_c: The first time through the loop k will have the value 0 and 0 % 2 returns 0 so the 0 will print.
       :feedback_d: This would be true if the test was (k % 3 == 0) and the loop started with k = 1.
       :feedback_e: The loop will stop when k has the value of 20.  So it won't print a 20.

       :feedback_b: This would be true if the first item in a list was at index 1, but it is at index 0.
       :feedback_c: This code adds "a" to the end of the list: ["a"] and then "b" to the end of the list: ["a", "b"].  Then it changes the value at index 1 to "c": ["a", "c"]. Then it adds "d" at position 2 which first moves to the right any existing values ["a", "c", "d"].   Then it sets the value at index 2 to "e": ["a", "c", "e"].  Then it adds "g" to the end: ["a", "c", "e", "g"].

       :correct: a
       :feedback_a: When p.m1() is run it will execute the m1 method in Child since p is an object of that class.  The first line calls super.m1() which will execute the m1 method in Parent. That method will print "pm1" and then call m2().  The m2 method in child will execute since p is a Child object.  The first line in that method calls super.m2() which will execute the m2 method in Parent.  This will print "pm2".  Then the parent m2 method will return, so execution will continue in the m2 method of Child and it will print "cm2".  Then the child m2 method will return which will continue execution in the m1 method of Child which will print "cm1".
       :feedback_b: This would be true if p was an object of the Parent class, but it is an object of the Child class and the runtime will start execution of a method in the Child class method if it has it.  
       :feedback_c: Remember that each method call is added to the call stack and after the method returns execution continues with the next statement after the method call.
       :feedback_d: This would be true if the m1 method in Parent didn't call m2().
       :feedback_e: This would be true if the m1 method in Parent didn't call m2() and the p was actually an object of the Parent class.

       :correct: a
       :feedback_a: This method prints the right most digit (x % 10 returns the right most digit) and then if x / 10 is not equal to 0 (x < 10) it returns mystery of the current number after chopping off the right most digit.  So mystery(4321) prints 1 and then calls mystery(432) which prints 2 and then calls mystery(43) which prints 3 and then calls mystery (4) which prints 4.  Since 4 / 10 is equal to 0 it won't do a recursive call. It prints 4 again and mystery(4) returns.  Execution will return to mystery(43) after the recursive call to mystery(4) and the 3 will print and then mystery (43) will return.  Execution will return to mystery(432) after the recursive call to mystery(43) and the 2 will print and then mystery (432) will return. Execution will return to mystery(4321) after the recursive call to mystery(432) and the 1 will print and then mystery (4321) will return. 
       :feedback_b: This would be true if there wasn't a second System.out.print(x % 10) after if.
       :feedback_c: This would be true if the first call to System.out.print(x % 10); wasn't in the method.
       :feedback_d: This would be true if it was mystery(1234). 
       :feedback_e: How does the 3 get printed first?  Remember that x % 10 returns the right most digit in x.

       :feedback_b: If a classroom is a room, then Classroom should extend Room (inherit from it).  If a Building has rooms it should have a field that holds them.  Since a Building can have more than one Room we can use an array to hold the rooms.
