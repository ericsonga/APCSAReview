Free Response - Delimiters A
------------------------------

..	index::
	  single: delimiters
    single: free response

The following is a free response question from 2019. It was question 3 part A on the exam. You can see all the free response questions from past exams at https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/free-response-questions-by-year.

3.   Many encoded strings contain *delimiters*. A delimiter is a non-empty string that acts as a boundary between
different parts of a larger string. The delimiters involved in this question occur in pairs that must be *balanced*,
with each pair having an open delimiter and a close delimiter. There will be only one type of delimiter for each
string. The following are examples of delimiters.

In this question, you will write two methods in the following ``Delimiters`` class.

Part A
========

(a) A string containing text and possibly delimiters has been split into *tokens* and stored in
``String[] tokens``. Each token is either an open delimiter, a close delimiter, or a substring that is not a
delimiter. You will write the method ``getDelimitersList``, which returns an ``ArrayList``
containing all the open and close delimiters found in ``tokens`` in their original order.

The following examples show the contents of an ``ArrayList`` returned by ``getDelimitersList`` for
different open and close delimiters and different ``tokens`` arrays.

How to Solve Part A
=====================

The method ``getDelimtersList`` needs to return an ``ArrayList`` of ``Strings`` containing all the open and close delimiters found in the ``tokens`` array in their original order.

This implies that the code needs to create an empty ``ArrayList`` of type ``String``.  Let's call it ``delList``.  The code will loop through the strings in the array ``tokens`` from the start to the end and if the current string is equal to either the ``openDel`` or ``closeDel`` it adds that string to the end of delList.  Finally it should return delList.

.. mchoice:: delim_solve_mc_1
   :answer_a: delList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
   :answer_b: ArrayList&lt;String&gt; delList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;;
   :answer_c: ArrayList&lt;String&gt; delList = new List&lt;String&gt;();
   :answer_d: ArrayList&lt;String&gt; delList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: You must declare the type for delList
   :feedback_b: You must include the () when creating a new object
   :feedback_c: You must create an ArrayList using a concrete subclass like ArrayList
   :feedback_d: The declared type must be the same or a parent class of the actual type.

   Which Java expression correctly creates an empty ArrayList of type String called delList?

.. mchoice:: delim_solve_mc_2
   :answer_a: while
   :answer_b: for
   :answer_c: for-each
   :answer_d: nested for loop
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: You can use a while loop, but it would make your code more error prone than another type of loop
   :feedback_b: You can use a for loop, but it would make your code more error prone than another type of loop
   :feedback_c: Since you need to loop through all the strings in the array tokens in order, a for-each loop would be best
   :feedback_d: There is no need for a nested loop in this situation

   Which loop would be best for this situation?

.. mchoice:: delim_solve_mc_3
   :answer_a: delList.set(0,item);
   :answer_b: delList.add(0,item);
   :answer_c: delList.remove(item);
   :answer_d: delList.add(item);
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would change the value at index 0 to item.
   :feedback_b: This would add item at index 0 and move right any other items in the list
   :feedback_c: This would remove item from the list
   :feedback_d: This adds item to the end of the list

   Which code adds item to the end of the list called delList?

.. mchoice:: delim_solve_mc_4
   :answer_a: if (token == openDel && token == closeDel)
   :answer_b: if (token == openDel || token == closeDel)
   :answer_c: if (token.equals(openDel) && token.equals(closeDel))
   :answer_d: if (token.equals(openDel) || token.equals(closeDel))
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: You should use .equals with strings and || for or
   :feedback_b: You should use .equals with strings
   :feedback_c: You should use || for or not &&
   :feedback_d: This returns true when openDel or closeDel have the same characters as token

   Which code correct checks if token is equal to (has the same characters as) openDel or closeDel?


Write the Code
==================

A string containing text and possibly delimiters has been split into *tokens* and stored in
``String[] tokens``. Each token is either an open delimiter, a close delimiter, or a substring that is not a
delimiter. You will write the method ``getDelimitersList``, which returns an ``ArrayList``
containing all the open and close delimiters found in ``tokens`` in their original order.

Write the method getDelimitersList in the code below. The main method contains code to test your solution.

.. activecode:: frq2019Q3A-delim
   :language: java

   import java.util.*;
   public class Delimiters
   {

       /** The open and close delimiters **/
       private String openDel;
       private String closeDel;

       /** Constructs a Delimiters object were open is the open delimiter and close is the
        *  close delimiter.
        *  Precondition: open and close are non-empty strings
        */
       public Delimiters (String open, String close)
       {
           openDel = open;
           closeDel = close;
       }

       /** Returns an ArrayList of delimiters from the array tokens, as described in part (a). */
       public ArrayList<String> getDelimtersList(String[] tokens)
       {
           /* to be implemented in part a */
       }

       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
           Delimiters d1 = new Delimiters("(", ")");
           String[] tokens = {"(", "x + y", ")", " * 5" };
           ArrayList<String> res1 = d1.getDelimtersList(tokens);
           System.out.println("It should print [(, )] and it prints" + res1);

           Delimiters d2 = new Delimiters("<q>", "</q>");
           String[] tokens2 = {"<q>", "yy", "</q>", "zz", "</q>"};
           ArrayList<String> res2 = d2.getDelimtersList(tokens2);
           System.out.println("It should print [<q>, </q>, </q>] and it prints" + res2);


       }
   }
