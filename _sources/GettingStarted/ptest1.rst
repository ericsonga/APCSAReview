Pretest for the AP CS A Exam
------------------------------

The following problems are similar to what you might see on the AP CS A exam.  The AP CS A exam is timed and you have 90 minutes to answer 40 questions, which is 2.25 minutes a question.  We are giving you 60 minutes to take this 20 question pretest.  We don't expect you to know all of these concepts
yet, but want to see what you do know.  

Click the |start| button when you are ready to begin the exam, but only then as you can only take the exam once.  Click on the |next| button to go to the next question.  Click on the |prev| button to go to the previous question.  Use the number buttons to jump to a particular question.  Click the |pause| button to pause the exam (you will not be able to see the questions when the exam is paused).  Click on the |finish| button after you have answered all the questions.  The number correct, number wrong, and number skipped will be displayed.

        :answer_e: Nothing will be printed due to an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: This would be true if the loop was printing each character twice and was incrementing the index by 1, but it prints two characters at a time and increments the index by 2.
        :feedback_b: This will loop through the string and print two characters at a time. The first time through the loop index = 0 and it will print "12". The second time through the loop index = 2 and it will print "34". The third time through the loop index = 4 and it will print "56". Remember that the substring method that takes two integer values will start the substring at the first value and include up to the character before the second value.
        :feedback_c: This would be true if the loop was loop printing three characters at a time, but it prints two characters at a time.
        :feedback_d: This would be true if the index was incrementing by 1 instead of 2.
        :feedback_e: This would be true if the loop stopped when index was less than the string length instead of one less than the string length.

        Given the following code segment, what is printed when it is executed? 
   
        .. code-block:: java

            String test = "123456";
            for (int index = 0; index < test.length() - 1; index = index + 2)
            {

        :answer_a: It is the length of the array nums. 
        :answer_b: It is the length of the first consecutive block of the value target in nums.
        :answer_c: It is the number of occurrences of the value target in nums.  
        :answer_d: It is the length of the shortest consecutive block of the value target in nums.
        :answer_e: It is the length of the last consecutive block of the value target in nums.    
        :correct: c
        :feedback_a: This can not be true. There is no nums.length in the code and the only count happens lenCount is incremented when nums[k] == target.
        :feedback_b: It does not reset the count ever so it just counts all the times the target value appears in the array.
        :feedback_c: The variable lenCount is incremented each time the current array element is the same value as the target. It is never reset so it counts the number of occurrences of the value target in nums. The method returns maxLen which is set to lenCount after the loop finishes if lenCount is greater than maxLen. 
        :feedback_d: It does not reset the count ever so it just counts all the times the target value appears in the array.
        :feedback_e: It does not reset the count ever so it just counts all the times the target value appears in the array.

   	    Consider the following data field and method ``findLongest``. Method ``findLongest`` is intended to find the longest consecutive block of the value target occurring in the array nums; however, ``findLongest`` does not work as intended. For example, if the array nums contains the values [7, 10, 10, 15, 15, 15, 15, 10, 10, 10, 15, 10, 10], the call ``findLongest(10)`` should return 3, the length of the longest consecutive block of 10s.  Which of the following best describes the value returned by a call to ``findLongest``?
   	   
   	    .. code-block:: java
   	   
   	        private int[] nums;
   	        public int findLongest(int target)
   	        {
   	           int lenCount = 0;
   	           int maxLen = 0;
   	        
   	           for (int k = 0; k < nums.length; k++)
   	           {
   	              if (nums[k] == target)
   	              {
   	                 lenCount++;
   	              }
   	           
   	              else
   	              {
   	                 if (lenCount > maxLen)
   	                 {
   	                    maxLen = lenCount;
   	                 }
   	             }
   	           }

        :answer_e: The loop won't finish executing because of a division by zero.   
        :correct: d
        :feedback_a: This would be true if the body of the while loop only executed one time, but it executes twice.
        :feedback_b: This would be true if the body of the while loop executed 3 times, but it exectues twice.
        :feedback_c: This would be true if the body of the while loop never executed. This would have happened if the while check was if var1 != 0 instead of var2 != 0.
        :feedback_d: The loop starts with var1=0 and var2=2. The while checks that var2 isn't 0 (2!=0) and that var1 / var2 is greater than or equal to zero (0/2=0) so this is equal to zero and the body of the while loop will execute. The variable var1 has 1 added to it for a new value of 1. The variable var2 has 1 subtracted from it for a value of 1. At this point var1=1 and var2=1. The while condition is checked again. Since var2 isn't 0 (1!=0) and var1/var2 (1/1=1) is >= 0 so the body of the loop will execute again. The variable var1 has 1 added to it for a new value of 2. The variable var2 has 1 subtracted from it for a value of 0. At this point var1=2 and var2=0. The while condition is checked again. Since var2 is zero the while loop stops and the value of var1 is 2 and var2 is 0.
        :feedback_e: The operation 0 / 2 won't cause a division by zero. The result is just zero.
       
        Given the following code segment, what are the values of ``var1`` and ``var2`` after the while loop finishes?

        :answer_e: I, II, and III  
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: Choice I uses multiple if's with logical ands in the conditions to check that the numbers are in range. Choice Choice II won't work since if you had a score of 94 it would first assign the grade to an "A" but then it would execute the next if and change the grade to a "B" and so on until the grade was set to a "C". Choice III uses ifs with else if to make sure that only one conditional is executed.
        :feedback_b: Choice II won't work since if you had a score of 94 it would first assign the grade to an "A" but then it would execute the next if and change the grade to a "B" and so on until the grade was set to a "C". This could have been fixed by using else if instead of just if.
        :feedback_c: Choice III is one of the correct answers. However, choice I is also correct. Choice I uses multiple if's with logical ands in the conditions to check that the numbers are in range. Choice III uses ifs with else if to make sure that only one conditional is executed.

        At a certain high school students receive letter grades based on the following scale: 93 or above is an A, 84 to 92 inclusive is a B, 75 to 83 inclusive is a C, and below 75 is an F.

        :feedback_a: This would be true if Susan was 5 years younger than Matt and three years ago she was twice his age. But, how could she be younger than him now and twice his age three years ago?
        :feedback_b: This is almost right. It has Susan as 5 years older than Matt now. But the second part is wrong. Multiplication will be done before addition so (2 * m + 3) won't be correct for in 3 years Susan will be twice as old as Matt. It should be (2 * (m + 3)) or (2 * m + 6).
        :feedback_c: This can't be right because Susan is 5 years older than Matt, so the first part is wrong. It has susan equal to Matt's age minus 5 which would have Matt older than Susan.
        :feedback_d: Susan is 5 years older than Matt so s == m + 5 should be true and in 3 years she will be twice as old so s + 3 = 2 * (m + 3) = 2 * m + 6.
        :feedback_e: The answer is s == m + 5 && s + 3 == 2 * m + 6.

        :answer_e: 0 2 1 0 2 1 0  
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: The second time through the loop the value of num is 2 and 2 % 3 is 2 not 1.
        :feedback_b: The while loop will iterate 8 times. The value of num each time through the loop is: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. The corresponding remainder operator of 3 is: 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, which is print to the console.
        :feedback_c: The loop will iterate 8 times not 9. When the value of num exceeds 14, num will no longer be evaluated against the conditional statements. The remainder operator of 3 will be evaluated on the num values of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14.
        :feedback_d: The value of num the first time through the loop is 0 so the first remainder is 0 not 2. This would be true if the value of num was 2 to start.
        :feedback_e: This would be true if the loop stopped when the value of num was less than 14 but it is less than or equal to 14.

        :feedback_c: Values larger then temp will not cause an infinite loop.
        :feedback_d: When a contains a value that is less than or equal to zero then multiplying that value by 2 will never make the result larger than the temp value (which was set to some value > 0), so an infinite loop will occur.

        :feedback_a: This would be true if it was return (a[1] *= 2); 
        :feedback_b: The statement a[1]--; is the same as a[1] = a[1] - 1; so this will change to 3 to 2.  The return (a[1] * 2) does not change the value at a[1].  
        :feedback_c: This would be true if it was return (a[0] *= 2);
        :feedback_d: This would be true if it was a[0]--;
        :feedback_e: This can't be true because a[1]--; means the same as a[1] = a[1] - 1; so the 3 changes to 2.  Parameters are all pass by value in Java which means that a copy of the value is passed to a method. But, since an array is an object a copy of the value is a copy of the reference to the object. So changes to objects in methods are permanent.

        :feedback_a: When the recursive call to mystery(1) occurs (the 4th call to mystery), the division of x /10 equals .01--this becomes 0 because this is integer division and the remainder is thrown away. Therefore the current call will be completed and all of the previous calls to mystery will be completed.
        :feedback_b: The first call to mystery with the integer 1234 will print 1234 % 10. The '%' means modulus or remainder. The remainder of 1234 divided by 10 is 4 so the first thing printed must be 4.
        :feedback_c: The first call to mystery with the integer 1234 will print 1234 % 10. The '%' means modulus or remainder. The remainder of 1234 divided by 10 is 4 so the first thing printed must be 4.
        :feedback_d: The first call to mystery with the integer 1234 will print 1234 % 10. The '%' means modulus or remainder. The remainder of 1234 divided by 10 is 4 so the first thing printed must be 4.
        :feedback_e: This has a recursive call which means that the method calls itself when (x / 10) is greater than or equal to zero. Each time the method is called it prints the remainder of the passed value divided by 10 and then calls the method again with the result of the integer division of the passed number by 10 (which throws away the decimal part). After the recursion stops by (x / 10) == 0 the method will print the remainder of the passed value divided by 10 again.

        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: This would be true if the object was created of type Base using new Base. But the object is really a Derived object. So all methods are looked for starting with the Derived class.
        :feedback_b: Even though b is declared as type Base it is created as an object of the Derived class, so all methods to it will be resolved starting with the Derived class. So the methodOne() in Derived will be called. This method first calls super.methodOne so this will invoke the method in the superclass (which is Base). So next the methodOne in Base will execute. This prints the letter "A" and invokes this.methodTwo(). Since b is really a Derived object, we check there first to see if it has a methodTwo. It does, so execution continues in Derived's methodTwo. This method invokes super.methodTwo. So this will invoke the method in the super class (Base) named methodTwo. This method prints the letter "B" and then returns. Next the execution returns from the call to the super.methodTwo and prints the letter "D". We return to the Base class methodOne and return from that to the Derived class methodOne and print the letter "C".
        :feedback_c: After the call to methodOne in the super class printing "A", the code continues with the implicit this.methodTwo which resolves from the current object's class which is Derived. methodTwo in the Derived class is executed which then calls super.methodTwo which invokes printin "B" from methodTwo in the Base class. Then the "D" in the Derive methodTwo is printed. Finally the program returns to methodOne in the Derived class are prints "C".
        :feedback_d: The call to methodTwo in super.methodOne is to this.methodTwo which is the method from the Derived class. Consequently the "D" is also printed.
        :feedback_e: This is not an example of recursion. No method is called from within itself.
