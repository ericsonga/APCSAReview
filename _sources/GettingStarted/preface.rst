About the Exam
----------------

This book is intended to help you review for the Advanced Placement Computer Science A Exam.  It was originally created as a review, but has been slowly becoming a complete textbook for the course as well.

For more information on the exam see https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/exam-practice.

The exam has two parts and takes 3 hours.  The first part has 40 multiple-choice questions.  The second part has 4 free response questions were you have to write Java code by hand.  In the past the multiple choice question part was 1 hour and 15 minutes, but as of spring 2016 it is 1 hour and 30 minutes.  The free response part will also be 1 hour and 30 minutes as of spring 2016.

We gratefully acknowledge the use of the Jobe server from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.  The Java programs in this eBook are actually running on the Jobe server.

Special thanks also to the following people that we have collaborated with:

* Jeff (Jochen) Rick made great contributions to the Parsons problems (mixed up code problems).

* Philip Guo who created the Java Visualizer, which we link to.  We would love to embed it in this ebook, but need someone to do that.

* Paul Resnick at the University of Michigan for hosting us all at the summer 2016 hackathon for Runestone Interactive and for his input into the design of the instructor dashboard.

* Brad Miller and David Ranum and the students at Luther College, who created the Runestone Interactive platform.  Brad Miller has been keeping it going for years.
