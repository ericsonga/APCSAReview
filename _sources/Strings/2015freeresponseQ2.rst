**QUESTION 2**

Consider a guessing game in which a player tries to guess a hidden word. 
The hidden word contains only capital letters and has a length known to the player. 
A guess contains only capital letters and has the same length as the hidden word.
After a guess is made, the player is given a hint that is based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess. 
Each position in the hint contains a character that corresponds to the letter in the same position in the guess. 
The following rules determine the characters that appear in the hint.

    Figure 1: Example showing the rules for giving hints.
    
The ``HiddenWord`` class will be used to represent the hidden word in the game. 
The hidden word is passed to the constructor. 
The class contains a method, ``getHint``, that takes a guess and produces a hint. 
For example, suppose the variable puzzle is declared as follows. 

.. code-block:: java

   HiddenWord puzzle = new HiddenWord("HARPS");

The following table shows several guesses and the hints that would be produced.

Write the complete ``HiddenWord`` class, including any necessary instance variables, its constructor, and the method, ``getHint``, described above. 
You may assume that the length of the guess is the same as the length of the hidden word.

**SOLVING QUESTION 2**

To write the ``HiddenWord`` class, we start with:

.. code-block:: java
	
   public class HiddenWord
	
To make the method, we are going to use Strings, which means we need a place to store the string. 
We will make a private class ``String`` called ``word`` to store the hidden word. We are making this class private 
because we don't want it to be accessed in other places.

.. code-block:: java

   private String word;

Now we need to make a constructor. We are going to put the guesses into ``String w``. 

.. code-block:: java

   public HiddenWord(String w)
	

Then we want to set answer equal to the input string, ``String w``. 
 	
.. code-block:: java

   word = w;
	 
	 
Next we are going to implement the ``getHint`` method. This method takes a string, which we will call ``String s``, where we will put guesses, 
and returns a string. 
We want this to be public so it can be accessed. 

.. code-block:: java
   
   public String getHint(String s)
	

We are going to make another string, called ``String hint``, and just set it equal to "" so we can build it up by character.
	
.. code-block:: java

   String hint = "";

To build up ``String hint``, we'll begin by making a for loop. It should start at zero and go to the length of ``String s``, increasing by one each time.

.. code-block:: java
   
   for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
	

Now we are going to make another string, ``String letter``, and set it equal to the part of ``String s`` from index i to i plus one. We do this because

.. code-block:: java

   String letter = s.substring(i, i+1);
	

Continuing to build up ``String`` hint, we will put an if loop in the for loop. 
If the character at i in the guess is the same as the character at i in the solution, then we want to output that character.

.. code-block:: java

   if (letter.equals(word.substring(i, i+1) 
   hint += letter;

If the character at index i is in the string, then we want the output to be ``+``.

.. code-block:: java

   else if (word.indexOf(letter) >= 0)
   hint += "+";

If the character at i in the guess is not in the solution at all, then we want to output to be ``*``.

.. code-block:: java

   else
   hint += "*";
	

Finally, we want to show the hint created so we return ``String hint``. 

.. code-block:: java

   return hint;
	
The final answer should look like:

.. code-block:: java

   public class HiddenWord
   {
   private String word;

   public HiddenWord(String w)
   {
   word = w;
   }  

   public String getHint(String s)
   {
   String hint = "";

   for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
   {
   String letter = s.substring(i, i+1);

   if (letter.equals(word.substring(i, i+1))) 1
   hint += letter;
   else if (word.indexOf(letter) >= 0)
   hint += "+";
   else
   hint += "*";
   }

   return hint;
   }
   }
