The following is a free response question from 2018.  It was question 4 on the exam.  You can see all the free response questions from past exams at https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/exam-practice.

**Question 4.** This question involves reasoning about arrays of integers. You will write two static methods, both of which are in a class named ``ArrayTester``.

.. code-block:: java

   public class ArrayTester
   {
       /** Returns an array containing the elements of column c of arr2D in the same order as 
        *  they appear in arr2D.
        *  Precondition: c is a valid column index in arr2D.
        *  Postcondition: arr2D is unchanged.
        */
       public static int[] getColumn(int[][] arr2D, int c)
       {  /* to be implemented in part (a) */  }

       /** Returns true if and only if every value in arr1 appears in arr2.
         * Precondition: arr1 and arr2 have the same length.
         * Postcondition: arr1 and arr2 are unchanged.
         */
       public static boolean hasAllValues(int [] arr1, int [] arr2)
       { /* implementation not shown */ }
       
       
       /** Returns true if arr contains any duplicate values;
         * false otherwise.
         */
       public static boolean containsDuplicates(int [] arr)
       { /* implementation not shown) */ }

       /** Returns true if square is a Latin square as described in part (b);
         * false otherwise.
         * Precondition: square has an equal number of rows and columns.
         * Precondition: square has at least one row.
         */ 
         public static boolean isLatin(int[][] square)
      {  /* to be implemented in part (b) */  }
   }

**Part a.**   Write a static method ``getColumn``, which returns a one-dimensional array containing the elements of a
single column in a two-dimensional array. The elements in the returned array should be in the same order as
they appear in the given column. The notation ``arr2D [r][c]`` represents the array at row ``r`` and
column ``c``.

The following code segment initializes an array and calls the ``getColumn`` method. 

``int [] [] arr2D = { { 0, 1, 2 }, { 3, 4, 5 }, { 6, 7, 8 }, { 9, 5, 3 } };``
``int[] result = ArrayTester.getColumn (arr2D, 1);``

When the code segment has completed execution, the variable result ``result`` will have the following contents.
``result: {1, 4, 7, 5}``

Try and Solve It
----------------

Complete the method ``getColumn`` below.

.. activecode:: isLatin
   :language: java

   public static int[] getColumn(int[] [] arr2D, int c)
   
   {
   
   } // end of class
   
   // Main method to test getColumn method
   public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    	int [] [] arr2D = { { 0, 1, 2 }, { 3, 4, 5 }, { 6, 7, 8 }, { 9, 5, 3 } };
    	int[] result = ArrayTester.getColumn (arr2D, 1);
        System.out.println("It should print the values from the second column, or 1 4 7 and 5.");
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++)
        {
           System.out.print(result[k] + " ");
        }

     } // end of main

} // end of class
