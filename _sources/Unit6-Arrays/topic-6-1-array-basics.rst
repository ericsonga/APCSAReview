Array Creation and Access
--------------------------

..	index::
	single: array
	single: index
	pair: array; index

To keep track of 10 exam scores, we could declare 10 separate variables:  int score1, score2, score3, … , score10; 
But what if we had 100 exam scores? That would be a lot of variables! Most programming languages have a simple **data structure** for a collection of related data that makes this easier. In App Inventor, this is called a list. In Java and many programming languages, this is called an **array**.

An **array** is a block of memory that stores a collection of data items of the same type under one name. Arrays are useful whenever you have many elements of data of the same type that you want to keep track of, but you don't need to name each one. Instead you use the array name and a number (called an **index**) for the position of an item in the array.

An array is like a row of small lockers, except that you can't cram lots of stuff into it. You can only store one value at each locker.

    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 1: A row of lockers

You can store a value in an array using an **index** (location in the array). An array index is like a locker number.  It helps you find a particular place to store your stuff and retrieve stuff.    You can get or store a value from or to an array using an index. Arrays and lists in most programming languages start counting elements from the number 0, so the first element in an array is at index 0. If you used App Inventor in the past, you might remember that list elements there start at 1 instead of 0, so make sure you remember that in Java, arrays start the index at 0!

.. shortanswer:: arrayAnalogy

   Can you think of another example of something that is like an array (like a row of lockers)?
   


Declaring and Creating an Array
===============================

When we declare a variable, we specify its type and then the variable name.  To make a variable into an array, we put square brackets after the data type. This data type will be for all the elements in the array.

.. code-block:: java 
   
   // Declaration for a single int variable 
   int score;
   // Declaration for an array of ints
   int[] scores;

The declarations do not create the array.  Arrays are **objects** in Java, so any variable that declares an array holds a reference to an object.  If the array hasn't been created yet and you try to print the value of the variable, it will print **null** (meaning it doesn't reference any object yet).  



To actually create an array after declaring the variable, use the **new** keyword with the type and the size of the array (the number of elements it can hold). This will actually create the array in memory.  You can do the declaration and the creation all in one step, see the String array names below. The size of an array is set at the time of creation and cannot be changed after that.

.. code-block:: java 
   
  //declare an array variable
  int[] highScores;
  // create the array
  highScores = new int[5];
  // declare and create array in 1 step!
  String[] names = new String[5];
  


|Exercise| **Check Your Understanding**

.. mchoice:: createarray
   :answer_a: int[] prices = new int[10];
   :answer_b: double[] prices = new double[10];
   :answer_c: double[] prices;
   :answer_d: double[10] prices = new double[];
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: We need double for money amounts in prices.
   :feedback_b: Yes correct!
   :feedback_c: This declares the array but does not create it with new.
   :feedback_d: This is not the correct syntax.
   
   Which of the following creates an array of 10 doubles called prices?

|CodingEx| **Coding Exercise**

In the following code, add another array declaration that creates an array of 5 doubles called prices and another array of 5 Strings called items and corresponding System.out.println commands.


.. activecode:: lcab1
   :language: java
   
   public class Test1
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        // Array example
        int[] highScores = new int[10];
        // Add an array of 5 doubles called prices.
        
        // Add an array of 5 Strings called items.
      
        System.out.println("Array highScores declared with size " + highScores.length);
      }
   }

..	index::
	pair: array; initialization
    
.. note::
  
   Array elements are initialized to 0 if they are a numeric type (``int`` or ``double``), ``false`` if they are of type ``boolean``, or ``null`` if they are an object type like ``String``.  

.. figure:: Figures/arrayIndicies.png
    :width: 200px
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 2: Two 5 element arrays with their values set to the default values for integer and object arrays.

Initializer Lists
============================

Another way to create an array is to use an **initializer list**. You can initialize (set) the values in the array to a list of values in curly brackets { } when you create it, like below.  In this case you don't specify the size of the array, it will be determined from the number of values that you specify.  

.. code-block:: java 

  int[ ] highScores = {99,98,98,88,68};
  String[ ] names = {"Jamal", "Emily", "Destiny", "Mateo", "Sofia"};
  
  

  
When you create an array of a **primitive type** (like ``int``) with initial values specified, space is allocated for the specified number of items of that type and the values in the array are set to the specified values.  When you create an array of an **object type** (like ``String``) with initial values, space is set aside for that number of object references.  The objects are created and the object references set so that the objects can be found.

    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 3: A primitive array and an object array

..	index::
    single: dot-notation
	pair: array; length



Arrays know their length (how many elements they can store).  It is a public read-only field so you can use **dot-notation** to access the field (``arrayName.length``).  **Dot-notation** is using variable name followed by a ``.`` and then the field (property) name or a method name. Try the following.

|CodingEx| **Coding Exercise**

Try running the code below to see the length. Try adding another value to the highScores initializer list and run again to see the length value change.

.. activecode:: lcab2
   :language: java
   
   public class Test2
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        int[ ] highScores = {99,98,98,88,68};
        System.out.println(highScores.length);
      }
   }

.. note::

   Note that length is a field and not a method, unlike the String ``length()`` method, so you don't add parentheses after length.  However, if you use parentheses after length during the exam, you won't lose any points.
   
.. .. shortanswer:: arrayQuestions

   What questions do you have about arrays?

|Exercise| **Check your understanding**
   
.. mchoice:: qab_2
   :answer_a: <code>highScores.length</code>
   :answer_b: <code>highScores.length - 1</code>
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Look at the example above when we were setting the values for the <i>highScore</i> array.  
   :feedback_b: Since the first element in an array is at index 0 the last element is the length minus 1.

   Which index is the last element in an array called ``highScores`` at?
 

Accessing Values in an Array 
=============================

To access the items in your array, we use an **indexed array variable** which is the array name and the index inside of square bracket [ ]. Remember that an **index** is a number that indicates the position of an item in a list, starting at 0. An indexed variable like **arrayname[index]** can be used anywhere a regular variable can be used, for example to assign a new value or to get a value from the array like below.


.. code-block:: java 
 
  // assign a new value 99 to the first element in the array
  highScores[0] = 99;
  // print the first element of the array
  System.out.println( highScores[0] );
  
.. note::

    The first value in an array is stored at index 0 and the index of the last value is the length of the array minus one (since the first index is 0). Use arrayname[index] to access array items.

   |blank|  = "Toyota";  

   -   :cars\[0\]: Correct.
       :x: Use the array name cars with [ ] with a number in it. Remember which index is for the first item in the array.

..  **Coding Exercise**

.. Try out the following code which has an int array of highScores and names. Can you print out 3rd score in the array (remember that the first score is at index 0)? Can you change last score to 97 using an assignment statement in the code? Can you change the array so that it has 6 elements and add another score and print it out? What happens if you try to access an element that is not there, for example at index 7?

.. .. activecode:: arrayAccess
   :language: java
   
   public class Test1
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        // declare and create arrays
        int[ ] highScores = new int[5];
        // Print initial highScore
        System.out.println(scores[0]);
        // put values in highScore using an indexed variable
        highScores[0] = 99;
        highScores[1] = 98;
        highScores[2] = 98;
        highScores[3] = 88;
        highScores[4] = 68;

        // Print first highScore at index 0
        System.out.println( highScores[0] );

      }
   }


   



If you want to keep track of the top 5 highest scores in a game and the names of the people with those scores, you could use two **parallel arrays**.  One array could keep track of the scores and the other the names. You have to make sure you keep them in the same order so that the same index can be used to get correponding names and scores. 

|CodingEx| **Coding Exercise**

Try out the following code which has two parallel arrays, highScores and names. Can you print out Mateo's score? Can you change Sofia's score to 97 using an assignment statement in the code? Can you change the arrays so that they have 6 elements and add your name and score and print them out? What happens if you try to access an element that is not there, for example at index 7?

.. activecode:: array-set
   :language: java
   
   public class Test1
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        // declare, create, initialize arrays
        int[ ] highScores = {99,98,98,88,68};
        String[ ] names = {"Jamal", "Emily", "Destiny", "Mateo", "Sofia"}; 
        
        // Print corresponding names and scores
        System.out.println(names[0] + " has a score of " + highScores[0]);
        System.out.println(names[1] + " has a score of " + highScores[1]);
      }
   }
   
   

.. note::

    Using an index value outside of 0 - (length-1) will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown.  
 

One powerful feature in the array **data abstraction** is that we can use variables for the index! As long as the variable holds an integer, we can use it as an index. 

.. code-block:: java 
 
  // use a variable for the index
  int index = 3;
  System.out.println(  highScores[index] );


|CodingEx| **Coding Exercise**

Here's a fun String array of image filenames. The following code displays an online image using an HTML tag. (Note that this just works in this Active Code window which interprets HTML. In other Java IDEs you would need to use Java Swing graphics instead). Run the code and see that it displays images[0] which is "cow.jpg". The images array holds 5 images. Can you change the index variable's value so that it  print out the puppy image? Can you print out the reindeer? Try all of them! What indices did you need to use? Then try using a random number for the index instead. Remember that (int)(Math.random()*max) will return a number from 0 up to max. What's the maximum number it can be for this array?

.. activecode:: imageArray
   :language: java
   
   public class ImageEx
   { 
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String[] images = {"cow.jpg", "kitten.jpg", 
                  "puppy.jpg", "pig.jpg", "reindeer.jpg"};
   
        ImageEx obj = new ImageEx();
        // Change index to see different images in the array!
        // Can you have it pick out a random image?
        int index = 0;
        obj.printHTMLimage( images[index] );
     }
      
     // This method will just work in Active Code which interprets html
     public void printHTMLimage(String filename)
     {
        String baseURL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhoffman0/APCSA-2019/master/_sources/Unit6-Arrays/6-1-images/";
        System.out.print("<img src=" + baseURL + filename + ">");
      }
    }  

|Groupwork| Programming Challenge : Countries Array
===================================================

In this challenge, you will create a guide to different countries using arrays. 

1. Use the Active Code window below to create 4 parallel arrays and intialize them using initialization lists that represent the data below. Remember that the order of these arrays has to match so that you can use the same index and get corresponding values out.

  - **Countries:** China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States
  - **Capitals:** Beijing, Cairo, Paris, Berlin, New Delhi, Tokyo, Nairobi, Mexico City, London, Washington D.C.
  - **Languages:** Chinese, Arabic, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, Spanish, English, English
  - **Filenames for map images:** China.jpg, Egypt.jpg, France.jpg, Germany.jpg, India.jpg, Japan.jpg, Kenya.jpg, Mexico.jpg, UK.jpg, US.jpg




2. Choose a random number using Math.random() and the **length** of one of the arrays and save it in a variable called index. 

3. Print out the country name, its capital, and its language, and the map image for that country using the random index to access the corresponding item in each parallel array. For the images, the printHTMLimage method has been given to get the image URL online and print it out as an HTML image.

.. activecode:: challenge-1-6-countries
   :language: java
   
   public class Countries
   {
     public static void main(String[] args)
     {
        // 1. Declare 4 arrays and initialize them to the values above
        
        // 2. Pick a random number up to the length of one of the arrays and save in the variable index
        
        // 3. Print out the info in each array using the random index
        
        // Sample image printing - this will only work in Active Code
         // Countries obj = new Countries();
         // obj.printHTMLimage( images[index] );

      }
      
      // This method will just work in Active Code which interprets html
      public void printHTMLimage(String filename)
      {
        String baseURL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhoffman0/APCSA-2019/master/_sources/Unit6-Arrays/6-1-images/";
        System.out.print("<img src=" + baseURL + filename + ">");
      }
     }
    
Summary
=========

- Arrays represent collections of related data all of the same data type. 

- The size of an array is established at the time of creation and cannot be changed.

- Arrays can store either primitive data or object reference data.

- When an array is created using the keyword new, all of its elements are initialized with a specific value based on the type of elements:

  - Elements of type int are initialized to 0
  - Elements of type double are initialized to 0.0
  - Elements of type boolean are initialized to false
  - Elements of a reference type are initialized to the reference value null. No objects are automatically created.
  
- Initializer lists can be used to create and initialize arrays.

- Square brackets ([ ]) are used to access and modify an element in a array using an index.

- The valid index values for an array are 0 through one less than the number of elements in the array, inclusive. Using an index value outside of this range will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown.
