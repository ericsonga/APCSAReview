The following is part a of a free response question that has been studied at colleges and universities.  

You will implement two unrelated methods for a ``Time`` class that keeps track of the time using a 24 hour clock.  Consider the code for the ``Time`` class provided below.  

**Part a.**  Write the method ``tick`` which increases the number of seconds by one.  If the number of seconds is 60 it adds one to the number of minutes and resets seconds to 0.  If the number of minutes is 59 it adds one to the number of hours and resets the number of minutes to 0.  If the number of hours reaches 24 it should be reset to 0.

.. code-block:: java 
   
   /**
    * Objects of the Time class hold a time value for 
    * a European‐style 24 hour clock.
    * The value consists of hours, minutes and seconds.
    * The range of the value is 00:00:00 (midnight) 
    * to 23:59:59 (one second before midnight).

    }
    
How to solve this problem
===========================

The first thing to do is try to solve the examples by hand.  The question tells us that when the value of minutes is 0, and seconds is 59 the method tick should result in minutes = 1 and seconds = 0.  When the value of minutes is 59 and the value of seconds is also 59 and the method tick is called the number of hours should increase and the minutes reset to 0. If the number of hours reaches 24 it should be reset to 0.  

Use conditionals (if statements) to check for each of these conditions and take the appropriate actions when each condition is true.  

**Part a.**  Write the method ``tick`` which increases the number of seconds by one.  If the number of seconds is 60 it adds one to the number of minutes and resets seconds to 0.  If the number of minutes is 59 it adds one to the number of hours and resets the number of minutes to 0.  If the number of hours reaches 24 it should be reset to 0.   When you have finished writing the method, click "Run" to test your solution.  The main method has code that will test your solution using several different times.
