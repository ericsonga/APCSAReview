Medium Multiple Choice Questions
----------------------------------

These problems are like those you will see on the AP CS A exam.

.. mchoice:: qalm_1
   :answer_a: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   :answer_b: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
   :answer_c: [1, 2, 5, 4, 6]
   :answer_d: [1, 5, 2, 4, 6]
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: The set replaces the 3 at index 2 with the 4 so this can't be right.
   :feedback_b: The add with an index of 2 and a value of 5 adds the 5 at index 2 not 3.  Remember that the first index is 0. 
   :feedback_c: The add method that takes just a value as a parameter adds that value to the end of the list.  The set replaces the value at that index with the new value.  The add with parameters of an index and a value puts the passed value at that index and moves any existing values by one index to the right (increments the index).  
   :feedback_d: The add with an index of 2 and a value of 5 adds the 5 at index 2 not 1.  Remember that the first index is 0.   

   What is printed as a result of executing the following code segment?
   
   .. code-block:: java
   
      List<Integer> list1 = new ArrayList<Integer>();
      list1.add(new Integer(1));
      list1.add(new Integer(2));
      list1.add(new Integer(3));
      list1.set(2, new Integer(4));
      list1.add(2, new Integer(5));
      list1.add(new Integer(6));
      System.out.println(list1);

   
.. mchoice:: qalm_2
   :answer_a: [0, 4, 2, 5, 3]   
   :answer_b: [3, 5, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]   
   :answer_c: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 5, 3]  
   :answer_d: [4, 2, 5, 3]     
   :answer_e: [0, 0, 4, 2, 5, 0, 3, 0]     
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: This code will loop through the array list and if the current value at the current index (k) is 0 it will remove it.  When you remove a value from an array list it moves all values to the right of that one to the the left. Since <code>k</code> is always incremented, this code will not remove the 2nd zero when there are two in a row.
   :feedback_b: This shows all zeros at the end and this code removes 0's so this can't be right.     
   :feedback_c: This shows all zeros at the beginning and this code removes zeros so this can't be right.  
   :feedback_d: This shows all zeros removed.  This would be correct if k was only incremented if a value wasn't removed. 
   :feedback_e: This shows the original values, but this code does remove some zeros so this can't be right.

   Given the following code and assume that ``nums`` initially contains [0, 0, 4, 2, 5, 0, 3], what will ``nums`` contain as a result of executing numQuest?
   
   .. code-block:: java 

      private List<Integer> nums;

      // precondition: nums.size() > 0;
      // nums contains Integer objects
      public void numQuest()
      {
        int k = 0;
        Integer zero = new Integer(0);
        while (k < nums.size())
        {
         if (nums.get(k).equals(zero))
           nums.remove(k);
         k++;
        }
      }


.. mchoice:: qalm_3
   :answer_a: Both methods produce the same result, and process1 is faster than process2.    
   :answer_b: The two methods produce different results and take the same amount of time.  
   :answer_c: The two methods produce different results, and process1 is faster than process2. 
   :answer_d: The two methods produce different results, and process2 is faster than process1.    
   :answer_e: Both methods produce the same result and take the same amount of time.   
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: In this case they do the same thing.  The only difference would be if there were values in the list in process2. 
   :feedback_b: These produce the same result on an empty list when you add to the end. 
   :feedback_c: These produce the same result on an empty list when you add to the end.   
   :feedback_d: These produce the same result on an empty list when you add to the end.  
   :feedback_e: The method process1 adds to the end of the list each time through the loop.  The method process2 also adds to the end of the list each time through the loop.  The only difference would be if there were values in the list in process2.  Any existing values would be moved to the right.  But, there are no existing values in the list at that index or beyond.  

   Which of the following best describes the behavior of process1 and process2 (shown below)?
   
   .. code-block:: java 
   
      public List process1(int n)
      {
         List<Integer> someList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
         for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
            someList.add(k);
         return someList;
      }
      
      public List process2(int n)
      {
         List<Integer> someList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
         for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
            someList.add(k, k);
         return someList;
      }
      
.. mchoice:: qalm_4
   :answer_a: [1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 3]
   :answer_b: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
   :answer_c: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   :answer_d: [1, 4, 2, 6, 3]
   :answer_e: [1, 2, 4, 6, 3]
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: The set replaces the 3 with the 4 so this can't be right.
   :feedback_b: The add with an index of 2 and a value of 5 adds the 5 at index 2 not 3.  Remember that the first index is 0. 
   :feedback_c: The add method that takes just a value as a parameter adds that value to the end of the list.  The set replaces the value at that index with the new value.  The add with parameters of an index and a value puts the passed value at that index and moves any existing values by one index to the right (increments the index).  
   :feedback_d: The add with an index of 2 and a value of 5 adds the 5 at index 2 not 1.  Remember that the first index is 0.   
   :feedback_e: When you declare and create a collection class you can specify the type of the items in it.  

   What is printed as a result of executing the following code segment?
   
   .. code-block:: java
   
     List<Integer> aList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
     aList.add(new Integer(1)); 
     aList.add(new Integer(2)); 
     aList.add(1, new Integer(5)); 
     aList.set(1, new Integer(4));
     aList.add(new Integer(6)); 
     aList.add(new Integer(3));
     System.out.println(list);
