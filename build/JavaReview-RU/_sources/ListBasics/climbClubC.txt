The following is part c of a free response question from 2012.  It was question 1 on the exam.  You can see all the free response questions from past exams at https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/exam-practice.  

**Question 1.**  A mountain climbing club maintains a record of the climbs that its members have made. Information about a
climb includes the name of the mountain peak and the amount of time it took to reach the top. The information is
contained in the ``ClimbInfo`` class as declared below.

.. code-block:: java
 
   public class ClimbInfo
   {
      /** Creates a ClimbInfo object with name peakName and time climbTime.
        * @param peakName the name of the mountain peak
        * @param climbTime the number of minutes taken to complete the climb
        */
      public ClimbInfo(String peakName, int climbTime)
      { /* implementation not shown */ }
      
      /** @return the name of the mountain peak*/
      public String getName()
      { /* implementation not shown */ }
     
      /** @return the number of minutes taken to complete the climb*/
      public int getTime()
      { /* implementation not shown */ }
     
      // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods 
      // that are not shown.
   }
   
The ``ClimbingClub`` class maintains a list of the climbs made by members of the club. The declaration of the
``ClimbingClub`` class is shown below. You will write two different implementations of the ``addClimb``
method. You will also answer two questions about an implementation of the ``distinctPeakNames`` method

.. code-block:: java

   public class ClimbingClub
   {
      /** The list of climbs completed by members of the club.
       * Guaranteed not to be null. Contains only non-null 
       * references.
       */
      private List<ClimbInfo> climbList;
   
      /** Creates a new ClimbingClub object. */
      public ClimbingClub()
      { 
         climbList = new ArrayList<ClimbInfo>(); 
      }
   
      /** Adds a new climb with name peakName and time climbTime 
       * to the list of climbs.
       * @param peakName the name of the mountain peak climbed
       * @param climbTime the number of minutes taken to complete 
       * the climb
       */
      public void addClimb(String peakName, int climbTime)
      { 
         /* to be implemented in part (a) */
      }
   
      /** @return the number of distinct names in the list of climbs */
      public int distinctPeakNames()
      { 
         /* implementation shown in part (c) */ 
      }
   
      // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods 
      // that are not shown.
   }

**Part c.**  The ``ClimbingClub`` method ``distinctPeakNames`` is intended to return the number of different
names in ``climbList``. For example, after the following code segment has completed execution, the value
of the variable ``numNames`` would be 3.

.. code-block:: java

   ClimbingClub hikerClub = new ClimbingClub();
   hikerClub.addClimb("Monadnock", 274);
   hikerClub.addClimb("Whiteface", 301);
   hikerClub.addClimb("Algonquin", 225);
   hikerClub.addClimb("Monadnock", 344);
   
Consider the following implementation of method distinctPeakNames.

.. code-block:: java

   /** @return the number of distinct names in the list of climbs */
   public int distinctPeakNames()
   {
      if (climbList.size() == 0)
      {
         return 0;
      }
      
      ClimbInfo currInfo = climbList.get(0);
      String prevName = currInfo.getName();
      String currName = null;
      int numNames = 1;
      for (int k = 1; k < climbList.size(); k++)
      {
         currInfo = climbList.get(k);
         currName = currInfo.getName();
         if (prevName.compareTo(currName) != 0)
         {
            numNames++;
            prevName = currName;
         }
      }
     return numNames;
   }
   
.. mchoice:: frqccc_1
   :answer_a: yes
   :answer_b: no
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Did you trace it to see what it would do?
   :feedback_b: This code depends on the peakNames being in alphabetical order by peakName.    

   Does this implementation of the ``distinctPeakNames`` method work as intended when the ``addClimb`` method stores the ``ClimbInfo`` objects in the order they were added as described in part (a)?

.. mchoice:: frqccc_2
   :answer_a: yes

   :feedback_b: Did you trace it to see what it would do?   

   Does this implementation of the ``distinctPeakNames`` method work as intended when the ``addClimb`` method stores the ``ClimbInfo`` objects in alphabetical order by name as described in part (b)?
