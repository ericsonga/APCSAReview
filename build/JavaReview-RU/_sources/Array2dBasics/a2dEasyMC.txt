Easy Multiple Choice Questions
----------------------------------

These problems are easier than most of those that you will usually see on the AP CS A exam.


.. mchoice:: qa2de_1
   :answer_a: 2
   :answer_b: 4
   :answer_c: 8
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: The size of outer list is the number of rows.
   :feedback_b: The size of the inner list is the number of columns.
   :feedback_c: This is the total number of items in the array.

   How many columns does ``a`` have if it is created as follows ``int[][] a = {{2, 4, 6, 8}, {1, 2, 3, 4}};``?	

.. mchoice:: qa2de_2
   :answer_a: <code>strGrid[0][2] = "S";</code>
   :answer_b: <code>strGrid[1][3] = "S";</code>
   :answer_c: <code>strGrid[3][1] = "S";</code>
   :answer_d: <code>strGrid[2][0] = "S";</code> 
   :answer_e: <code>strGrid[0][0] = "S";</code>
   :correct: d  
   :feedback_a: The code <code>letterGrid[0][2] = "S";</code> actually sets the 1st row and 3rd column to hold a reference to the <code>String</code> object "S".
   :feedback_b: This would be true if row and column indicies started at 1 instead of 0 and if this was in column major order. 
   :feedback_c: This would be true if row and column indicies started at 1 instead of 0.  
   :feedback_d: In row-major order the row is specified first followed by the column.  Row and column indicies start with 0.  So <code>letterGrid[2][0]</code> is the 3rd row and 1st column. 
   :feedback_e: This would set the element at the first row and column.   

   Which of the following statements assigns the letter S to the third row and first column of a two-dimensional array named ``strGrid`` (assuming row-major order).
   
.. mchoice:: qa2de_3
   :answer_a: a[0][3]
   :answer_b: a[1][3]
   :answer_c: a[0][2]
   :answer_d: a[2][0]
   :answer_e: a[3][1]
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the row index started at 0, but the column index started at 1.
   :feedback_b: Both the row and column indicies start with 0.  
   :feedback_c: The value 6 is at row 0 and column 2.  
   :feedback_d: The row index is specified first, then the column index.
   :feedback_e: The row index is specified first and the indicies start at 0.  

   How would you get the value 6 out of the following array ``int[][] a = {{2, 4, 6, 8}, {1, 2, 3, 4}};``?
