Running a Java Program
==============================

..  index::
	pair: Java; run program
	pair: Java; main method
   
When you click the |runbutton| button Java starts execution in the ``main`` method as shown in the code below (``public static void main(String[] args)``).  The body of the main method is all the code between the first ``{`` and the last ``}``.  Every class in Java can have a main method.  

If you are executing a Java program using the command line tools you will type ``java ClassName`` and execution will start in the specified class's ``main`` method. 

A ``main`` method should create the objects
that will do the work in an object-oriented program and then ask the objects to do the work. The following is the ``main`` method for the Person class.  It shows two variables (``p1`` and ``p2``) of type Person being created and each of the variables refers to a new Person object. Each new Person object's name and phone number are set to the passed values (``new Person("Deja", "555 132-3253")``).  Then each object's ``toString`` method is called to output information about the object.  The ``toString`` method is called when you try to print the value of an object using ``System.out.println(object);``. 

.. code-block:: java

     //////////// main for testing //////////////
     public static void main(String[] args)
     {
       Person p1 = new Person("Deja", "555 132-3253");
       System.out.println(p1);
       Person p2 = new Person("Avery", "555 132-6632"); 
       System.out.println(p2);
     }

Some books show having a main method in another class which is often called a runner class, but this is not required.  
I like to have a ``main`` method in each of my classes that tests the methods in that class.  The ``main`` method in the ``Person`` class creates two ``Person`` objects and prints their values out using the ``toString`` method.  The ``toString`` method is what is called on an object when you execute ``System.out.println(object)``. 
   
Try changing the code in the main method below (``public static void main(String[] args)`` that creates as new Person object ``new Person("Deja", "555 132-3253")`` to create an object to represent you and one of your friends (but don't use your actual phone numbers).  Click the |runbutton| button to test your code.
