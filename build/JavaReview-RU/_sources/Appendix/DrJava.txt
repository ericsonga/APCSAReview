The tool that we use to compile a Java source file into a Java class file is called a **compiler**.  I recommend using an **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE). An IDE helps you write, compile, run, and debug programs.  I recommend using DrJava (from http://DrJava.org).  It is free and easy to use.  I particularly like the **interactions pane** (the bottom area) which lets you try out Java code without having to create a class first.
