----------------------------------

These problems are easier than most of those that you will usually see on the AP CS A exam.


.. mchoice:: qre_1
   :answer_a: 1
   :answer_b: 3
   :answer_c: 4
   :answer_d: 5
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This is the method declaration.  Look for a call to the same method in the body of the method.
   :feedback_b: This is a conditional, not a method call.
   :feedback_c: This is a return statement, not a method call.
   :feedback_d: This line contains a call to the same method which makes this method recursive.

   Which line has the recursive call?
   
   .. code-block:: java 
      :linenos:
   
      public static int factorial(int n)
      {
         if (n == 0)
            return 1;
         else return n * factorial(n-1);
      }

   :answer_b: 3
   :answer_c: 4
   :answer_d: 5
   :answer_e: 6
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: This is the method declaration.  Look for a call to the same method in the body of the method.
   :feedback_b: This is a conditional, not a method call.
   :feedback_c: This is a return statement, not a method call.
   :feedback_d: This is an else which is part of a conditional, not a method call.
   :feedback_e: This line contains a call to the same method which makes this method recursive.

   Which line has the recursive call?
   
   .. code-block:: java 
      :linenos:
   
      public String starString(int n) 
      {
         if (n == 0) {
            return "*";
         } else {
            return starString(n - 1) + starString(n - 1);
         }

.. mchoice:: qre_3
   :answer_a: 0
   :answer_b: 1
   :answer_c: 2
   :answer_d: 3
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Look at line 7 more closely.
   :feedback_b: Many recursive methods only have one recursive call.  But, this one has two.
   :feedback_c: Line 7 has two calls to <code>fibonacci</code>.
   :feedback_d: There are not 3 calls to <code>fibonacci</code>.

   How many recursive calls does the following method contain?
   
   .. code-block:: java 
      :linenos:
   
      public static int fibonacci(int n)
      {
         if (n == 0)
            return 0;
         else if (n == 1)
            return 1;
         else return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
  	  }

   :answer_d: 3
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Look for a call to the same method in the body of the method.
   :feedback_b: Line 6 has one call to <code>multiplyEvens</code>.
   :feedback_c: Where do you see 2 calls to <code>multiplyEvens</code>?
   :feedback_d: Where do you see 3 calls to <code>multiplyEvens</code>?

   How many recursive calls does the following method contain?
   
   .. code-block:: java 
      :linenos:
   
      public static int multiplyEvens(int n) 
      {
         if (n == 1) {
            return 2;
         } else {
            return 2 * n * multiplyEvens(n - 1);
         }
