Common Mistakes
===============

  -  Using two ``if``'s one after the other instead of an ``if`` and ``else``.    
  
  -  Trouble with complex conditionals which are two or more Boolean expression joined by ``&&`` or ``||``.  

  -  Trouble with understanding or applying negation (``!``).  
  
  -  Not understanding short circuit evaluation which is that if evaluation of the first Boolean expression is enough to determine the truth of a complex conditional the second expression will not be evaluated.
