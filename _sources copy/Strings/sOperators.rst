String Operators - Concatenation
==================================

..	index::
	pair: String; append
	
Strings can be **appended** to each other which creates a new string using the ``+`` operator . This is also called **concatenation**. 

.. activecode:: lcso1
   :language: java
   
   public class Test1
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        String start = "Happy Birthday"; 
        String name = "Jose";
        String result = start + " " + name;
        System.out.println(result);
      }
   }
  
Note that spaces are not added between strings automatically.  If you want a space between two strings then add one. 

..	index::
	single: toString
	pair: Object; toString

You can even add other items to a string using the ``+`` operator.  The other item will be converted to a string using the ``toString`` operator if it is an object and then appended to the current string.  All objects inherit a ``toString`` method that returns a string representation of the object.  If you are appending number to a string it will be converted to a string first before being appended.  What do you think the following will print?   

.. activecode:: lcso2
   :language: java
   
   public class Test2
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        String message = "12" + 4 + 3; 
        System.out.println(message);
      }
   }
  
Since the same operators are processed from left to right this will print ``1243``.  First 4 will be turned into a string and appended to 12 and then 3 will be turned into a string and appended to 124.  If you want the addition to take place before the numbers are turned into a string what should you do?  Try to modify the code above so that it adds 4 + 3 before appending the value to the string.
